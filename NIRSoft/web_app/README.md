# Backend Web Application

This is the backend part of the web application project. It is built using Python and is responsible for handling requests, processing data, and sending responses to the frontend.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd web-app-project/backend
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   It is recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   Install the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Backend Server**
   Execute the `arayuz.py` file to start the backend server.
   ```bash
   python arayuz.py
   ```

5. **Access the API**
   The backend server will be running at `http://localhost:5000` (or the port specified in `arayuz.py`). You can make API calls to this endpoint from the frontend.
